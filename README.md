# FIFA-world-cup-2018---An-exploration

This project is for me to demonstrate what I have learnt in R so far in the ‘Data analyst using R’ path of Dataquest 
(upto intermediate programming in R). The techniques used to teach R is great for beginners. Nevertheless, they are quite rudimentary.

But, the questions that are explored are quite interesiting, and my objective is to google new methods to make the task easier. 
For techniques that I haven’t gotten to yet but find from the internet, I will post the links to which I referred.

installed on your computer.**
