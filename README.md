# FIFA-world-cup-2018---An-exploration

This project is for me to demonstrate what I have learnt in R so far from Dataquest (upto the Intermediate level)
The techniques used to teach R is great for beginners. Nevertheless, they are quite rudimentary.

But the questions that are explored are quite interesiting, and my objective is to google new methods to make the task easier. 
For techniques that I havenâ€™t gotten to yet but find from the internet, I will post the links to which I referred. 
I use a dataset different from the one in the course and explore questions that I personally feel are more significant given the data. 
You will find more information in the notebook's markdown itself. 

**To view the project kindly download the .html file and open it using any browser. You can also run the .Rmd file if you have RStudio
installed on your computer.**
